Wrong twice. 
<h2>
    <span>
        <div class="m-frame-title">Happening</div>
    </span>
    <span>
        <div class="m-frame-headline">Now</div>
    </span>
</h2>  



Still wrong.
<h2>
    <div class="m-frame-title">Today's</div>
    <div class="m-frame-headline">Specials</div>
</h2> 



Better!
<h2>
    <span class="headline">
        Latest
    </span>
    <span class="title">
        News
    </span>
</h2>   

Why would you do this?
Designers often ask for visual distinction when considering the overarching titles/headings of unique components. Sometimes it's based on the content of the components, other times it's an overarching design decision in a system to allow for multi-line presentation of titles. 

What about accessibility?
"Visual distinction" is only a problem if you only build it that way. In example 1, screen readers may pick up on text and headings separately, which isn't great. You'll get the same information repeated twice and in this case, also mis-identified as clickable once. 

What else is wrong here?
It's invalid HTML. Headings can only contain phrasing content, not flow content.
