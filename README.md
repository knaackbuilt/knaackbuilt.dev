This is my personal website.

If you don't like utility-based css, sorry. I don't love it, but it's easier and faster to iterate and test with. I also hate bem and naming conventions in general. Name it what it is, or leave it as css utilities. No one understands inner-outer__temporary-second___inner-wrapper_button-inner. I've never seen two developers use bem the same way and at least utilities say what they are. Then again 453 classes on a single element is garbage too. It's all terrible lets just forget the whole internet.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
